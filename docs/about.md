# About MRICloudPy

MRICloud is a brain mapping, neuroinformatics tool used to generate hierarchical brain volumetric data from subject-specific MRI images. MRI data, in general, is complex, and difficult to work with, including MRICloud data. Generally, no software exists to convert even processed MRI data to analytic datasets for analysis, visualization, and further manipulation. Current data processing approaches require manual, error-prone procedures. Furthermore, these approaches involve the delicate management of interrelated hierarchical and subject volume information. Thus, a tool was developed to streamline MRICloud data processing.

MRICloudPy was developed by the Caffo Lab at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics, providing researchers an easy tool for creating analytic datasets, providing many visualizations and analyses out of the box.
